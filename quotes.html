            <h1>Quotes</h1>
            <p> "Caddyshack," the iconic 1980 golf comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, and written by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray & Douglas Kenney has etched itself into the annals of cinematic history for its unforgettable characters, uproarious gags, and a treasure trove of quotable lines. From the manic antics of Rodney Dangerfield's Al Czervik to the irreverent wisdom of Bill Murray's Carl Spackler, "Caddyshack" is a veritable goldmine of one-liners and memorable dialogue.</p>
