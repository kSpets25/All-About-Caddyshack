## Group 3 - Assignment 11 - Final Project

### Assignment Challenges


<br>

As the group leader of this assignment, everything became a challenge.  First, after creating the repository, the decision to add all the pages or just let the team member add the page was a question.  The initial page files were added by the team leader in hopes of better merging of files when completing the first commit. 

 Next, adding the team as contributors worked well and all team members were able to join. The branch protection was put in place. Team members were given their choice of a page to complete for the project.

We lost the assistance of one team member on the project.
 
 When the first commit finally came though, for some reason, even though the team leader created the respoitory, another team member was showing up as needed to accept the commit and perform the merge.  Very confusing.  It was discovered that not all team members had created a branch. New branches were subsequently created. When a commit came in and forced the review, once the review was performed and resolved the branch protection was removed in order to merge the commit to the main branch.  This worked well.

 All team members worked to code their chosen pages,  Communication for purposes of a group project is not easy.  We used zoom which only gave us 40 minutes each time but worked best for the group.  at least 4 meetings were held to discuss the project. 

Coordinating the css code using BEM naming was a challenge for all of us.  The team worked hard to create the BEM classess for their tags and elements and incorporate those in the css file.

 When the repository page was deployed some photos were not showing up on the photos page. This was resolved and the page was up and running.

 The repository page was checked with lighthouse, with excellent results, and for responsiveness.

 In all the website turned out great!
