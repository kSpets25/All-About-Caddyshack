                <p class="summary__text" >"Caddyshack" is a classic 1980 comedy film directed by Harold Ramis. The movie is set at the upscale Bushwood Country Club and primarily revolves around the misadventures of its eccentric members and staff.

                The film features various subplots, with one of the main storylines focusing on the antics of the club's groundskeeper, Carl Spackler (played by Bill Murray), who is obsessed with catching a pesky gopher that's been wreaking havoc on the golf course. Another central plot involves Danny Noonan (played by Michael O'Keefe), a young caddy who seeks to win a college scholarship by ingratiating himself with the wealthy and often bizarre members of the club.
                
                The film also features unforgettable characters like Al Czervik (played by Rodney Dangerfield), a boisterous and wealthy newcomer to the club, and Judge Elihu Smails (played by Ted Knight), the snobbish club president who constantly clashes with Czervik.
                
                "Caddyshack" is known for its slapstick humor, irreverence, and memorable one-liners, as well as its iconic golf scenes. It's considered a cult classic and is celebrated for its zany characters and chaotic events, making it a beloved comedy in the world of American cinema.
